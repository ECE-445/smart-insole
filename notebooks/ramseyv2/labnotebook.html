<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>During this session, I embarked on a comprehensive tutorial that spanned approximately 4 hours, dedicated to creating a custom PCB for an ESP32 S3 chip. This tutorial was instrumental in guiding me through the process of reading humidity levels using an ENS210 module and subsequently activating an RGB light based on the humidity readings. Given that the humidity sensor's functionality was not pertinent to our smart insole project, I modified the design to exclude this component.</p>
<p>Throughout the tutorial, I acquired valuable skills and knowledge in several key areas:</p>

<p>Today's session was highly productive, significantly advancing my proficiency in PCB design for the ESP32 chip using KiCad. By following the detailed tutorial, I not only adapted an existing design for our project's needs but also deepened my understanding of crucial components and calculations needed for a successful PCB design. Moving forward, I will continue to refine the design and explore additional functionalities that could enhance the smart insole project.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Address missing footprints for buttons, resistors, capacitors, and pin headers in the PCB design from February 29.</li>
<li>Ensure the ability to work asynchronously on individual devices without issues related to KiCad's library imports and paths.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>During this session, our primary goal was to rectify an oversight from the initial PCB design created on February 29. We discovered that the design was lacking essential footprints. This was relatively straightforward and we just had to use a large enough SMD component.</p>
<p>However, we encountered significant challenges related to KiCad's library management system, which hampered our ability to work efficiently across different devices. As we attempted to work asynchronously, moving the project files from one device to another led to multiple instances of library import errors and path misconfigurations. This resulted in the unlinking of previously linked footprints, causing a critical issue where updating the PCB from the schematic would fail due to these broken links. We were able to relink footprints every time we opened the project after an update had been pushed to our GitHub, but this was a very hacky solution.</p>

<h2 id="notebook-entry-march-4th">Notebook Entry: March 4th</h2>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement debouncing for buttons in the PCB design, following the guidelines from the CAD assignment on the course wiki.</li>
<li>Collaborate with the team to finalize the initial PCB schematic design.</li>
<li>Attend a PCB design review session for expert advice on voltage regulation and battery considerations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>This session's agenda was primarily focused on refining our PCB design, with specific attention to debouncing the buttons, a critical step as outlined in our CAD assignment available on the course wiki. The process involved the integration of hardware debouncing mechanisms into our design to ensure reliable button operation, preventing the erroneous signals that can result from mechanical switch bounce.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we worked as a team to put the finishing touches on our initial PCB schematic design. This involved a comprehensive review of all components and connections to ensure that our design was robust and free of errors. The collaborative effort was crucial in identifying and rectifying minor issues that had previously gone unnoticed, thereby strengthening the overall design.</p>
<p>A significant portion of the session was also dedicated to a PCB design review session, where we received guidance from a TA. One of the insights gained was the necessity of regulating voltage with our Low Dropout Regulator (LDO). The TA highlighted a potential issue with our power supply strategy, particularly concerning the use of a lithium-ion battery with a voltage range of 3.7 to 3.0 volts and an LDO with a low cutoff voltage of 3.43 volts when outputting 3.3 volts. This advice prompted us to reevaluate our power management approach to ensure that our device could operate reliably across the full range of the battery's voltage without encountering power instability due to the LDO's cutoff threshold.</p>

<p>This session was pivotal in advancing our PCB design project, bringing us closer to a finalized schematic that meets both our functional requirements and the technical specifications outlined in our course. The insights from the PCB design review session were particularly helpful, underscoring the importance of power management and component selection in ensuring the reliability and longevity of our design. Future sessions will be dedicated to adjusting our power supply strategy and continuing to refine our schematic based on the feedback received.</p>

<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>In previous work sessions, I followed an online tutorial intended for an ESP32 mini chip. However, this approach proved to be somewhat problematic as the tutorial's specifications did not align with the ESP32 microcontroller models we had access to in our lab.

<ul>
<li>Conduct routing and placement of Surface-Mount Device (SMD) components on our PCB.</li>
<li>Optimize component layout to prevent overlap and ensure efficient use of space.</li>
<li>Address and resolve Design Rule Check (DRC) violation errors, specifically focusing on the min angular width violation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>The focus of this session was on the placement and routing of SMD components for our PCB project. The challenge lay in strategically organizing the components to avoid any overlap of connections, which required a careful consideration of each component's footprint and the available board space. This task was critical in ensuring that our design was not only functional but also adhered to best practices in PCB layout design.</p>
<p>Upon completing what we initially believed to be the final design, I took the lead in addressing the DRC violation errors that emerged. DRC is a crucial step in PCB design, as it helps identify and rectify issues that could lead to manufacturing defects or functional failures.</p>
<p>One of the most prevalent issues we encountered was the min angular width violation. This particular error proved to be a significant obstacle due to the small size of the pins on the components we had chosen. The violation was primarily because the pin dimensions fell below the minimum width allowed by our design rules, which could potentially lead to problems in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>To mitigate this issue, we decided to increase the diameter of the ground pads associated with the problematic components. This adjustment was carefully calculated to ensure that it would not introduce new layout challenges, while also resolving the min angular width violation. The process involved detailed analysis and modification of the PCB design to accommodate the larger pad sizes without compromising the overall layout or the functionality of the board.</p>
<h2 id="figures">Figures:</h2>
<ul>

<p>This session was geared towards advancing our PCB design towards finalization. By addressing the DRC violation errors, specifically the challenging min angular width violation, we moved closer to ensuring that our design would be manufacturable and function as intended. In this session, we ended up reducing our total DRC violation errors from ~200 to 43 errors.</p>

This discrepancy required significant modifications to the circuitry, particularly in the method through which we’d be programming the board, along with a few minor adjustments to ensure compatibility with our hardware. I had thought previously to just use the USB connection we had to program and interface with the ESP 32 chip. However Jason brought it to our attention in office hours that this would be a very finicky method and we should instead use UART headers in order to program and test our PCB design.</p>

This problem was similar to that of March 6th but we were needing to complete and fix these errors in order to place our PCB order by 4:45 Tuesday</p>
<p>Upon finishing our DRC checks I took the lead in working to generate the Gerber files and uploading them to PCB for a final DRC check. This ultimately was error free which was super nice as we didn't have to fix anything last minute. However it did take a lot longer than expected to get the gerber files reviewed on PCB. ~1 hour vs the estimated 15 minutes.</p>

<p>looked into several web development frameworks for our Smart Insole project and determined that plain HTML lacked the advanced features needed for Bluetooth connectivity and dynamic data visualization, while Next.js was more complex than required due to us not needing a backend. React emerged as the best choice due to its balance of functionality and ease of use, along with its support for NPM modules. I then initialized a new React application, removing unneeded boilerplate to tailor it to our project's requirements. Additionally, I explored the Chart.js module, finding it versatile for our needs to display data from the Smart Insole, making it the selected tool for our data visualization efforts.</p>

<p>Worked with react to install and integrate the chart.js NPM module. This module allows us to use charts like line, pie, bar, bubble, scatter, radar, and more. We will use this to display user data in an easily understandable way. I installed the module using <code>npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2</code>. This was a point of contention as I spent a lot of time trying to use chart.js which doesn't integrate with react well. After which I googled how to add this in react and there were some helpful links. From here it was easy to integrate the module and display random data on a line chart which will be most useful in displaying user data. This will be used for elevation gain charts, distance charts, step charts, average speed charts, and many more.</p>

<p>Worked with Tony to write arduino code to set up a bluetooth server that our web interface could connect to and communicate with. I was in charge of the react side while Tony worked on setting up his drivers to program the ESP 32 dev board with the Arduino IDE. We stumbled upon a super helpful resource which detailed arduino and html code which would allow up to receive an incrementing number upon connection of a device to the ESP 32. This was done with HTMl and needed to be highly adapted to our React interface. For example the tag selection doesn't work with React and instead we use onclick={} properties. Another thing we needed to correct was the dynamic updates and to do this we had to use the UseState react hook. This eventually worked and was able to connect with the programmed esp32 from Tony. I then edited the code to accept more than just integer values.</p>

<p>Worked with Alyssa to solder on our SMD components with the help of solder paste and a solder mask. This was a learning process as we first used too much solder and it bridged the pads. However next we used too little and the component didn't connect to the pads. After which we used a tad too much making some pads bridged and some not. At this point we looked into programming and realized that the pins supposed to connect to the programming pins were not mapped right. D+ was supposed to be mapped to GPIO 19 and D- was supposed to be on GPIO20. After further analysis into our board connections we realized that most of the GPIO had special functions and couldn't be used for general purpose. Other areas we messed up were our strapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chip boot mode – GPIO and GPIO46</li>
<li>VDD_SPI voltage – GPIO45</li>
<li>ROM messages printing – GPIO46</li>
<li>JTAG signal source – GPIO3</li>
</ul>
<p>We mapped these pins willy nilly or just didn't have them and didn't realize that they couldn't be remapped. As such we decided to not continue with the PCB creation. Instead we moved on to redoing our PCB to account for the mismapped pins. Another thing we realized was wrong was that we had to map out the voltage divider to the Analog to Digital compatible pins in order to read our voltage outputs reliably. As such we took this time to redo our PCB and get an initial version to look over and adjust after.</p>

<p>Worked to fix DRC errors when making the board. These included the ones detailed earlier where we were having min angular width errors on footprints of some of our components including the Micro USB connector, the SD card holder, and a few other such components. Throughout this process we worked to add in vias for circuit protection. Additionally we had to connect isolated islands or reconnect components such that we didn't end up with these islands. This process was quite long but can be summed up by saying googled and corrected errors on our PCB in Kicad.</p>
<p>After I worked on correcting the DRC errors Alyssa wanted to make the PCB smaller. As such we discussed components to remove and decided on removing mounting holes and buttons on the board to reduce board size so it is easier to mount to a shoe. This reduced the size quite a bit but caused Alyssa to take over on correcting the new DRC errors.</p>

<p>We needed to remake a bunch of connections again as we realized that we needed to remap channel 2 of our analog to digital pins to channel 1. This was because when the bluetooth module is active we couldn't read from these pins as the bluetooth module would be using them. Additionally I had to conduct thermal analysis knowing the bluetooth module would use 300 mA of power which our LDO would drop 1.7 V of power. This means that .51 Watts of power would be dissipated by the LDO. This seems to be ok but may need a heatsink on top to reduce this power draw.</p>
<p>We realized that the bluetooth module when on would deactivate channel 2 for Analog to Digital compatible pins and as such had to account for that by remapping pins. However we were unable to remap all pins and as such had to think of a different solution. I thought to add another button to activate bluetooth pairing or deactivate it while a hiker wanted to offload data. This would shut off the data recording and would allow for us to validate that we wouldn't use channel 2.</p>
<p>Alongside this I fixed many DRC errors and also remapped wires. Additionally I placed an updated SD card footprint on the board as our original one was throwing an error which neither the TA, Google nor I could figure out. Jason at his office hour looked over our board and realized we needed to move our micro usb to the edge which I did.</p>
<p>Some errors I fixed in office hours were:</p>
<ul>
<li>foot print expected though hole got SMD</li>
<li>Same error on example ESP 32 board and Jason confirmed this was expected</li>
<li>min spoke count expected 2 got 1 when copper ground sheets only connect by one direction to ground pins.</li>
<li>Same error on example ESP 32 board and Jason confirmed this was expected</li>
<li>min angular width of default footprints for micro USB</li>
<li>Same error on example ESP 32 board and Jason confirmed this was expected</li>

<p>I wanted to prototype the file read/write/edit operations on the SD card with the ESP 32 S3 dev board. The first step was to get the SD module in a state which would allow us to read. I chose the SD card module as it used the least components between the pins and the pinouts. To get the board working I had to solder on a pin header to attach wires to and from the ESP 32 dev board. I found a few tutorials online on how to hook up the SD card module to the ESP32. However it was a different version of the chip/board and the pinouts had different protocols. This forced me to try and remap the pins to the different ones. After browsing I found a reddit post with the following pinout &quot;MOSI (FSPID) aligns to GPIO11, MISO (FSPIQ) aligns with GPIO13, and SCK (FSPICKLER) aligns with GPIO12''. This all online code I tried ended up working with the Arduino DS card and SPI modules.</p>

<p>This day we demoed our bread boarded smart insole device to our TA and got feedback on what we should prioritize and what our estimated point total would be. This was a lot lower than we wanted and caused us to redouble our efforts towards creating a working PCB. I also worked to create a printed enclosure for our PCB which could be mounted with velcro or with a clip to the inside of the shoe. I worked to design the part in Fusion 360 where I was somewhat comfortable with 3D modeling. I used the dimensions on Kicad to create an enclosure that would fit our PCB. This was an important process as one of our high level requirements was to make a modular design which would not impede a hiker. I tried to design this enclosure to be as compact as possible while still maintaining functionality. This required holes for LEDs, buttons, and wires to get through. Additionally I consulted the relevant footprint datasheets for the dimensions of the components which would allow us to fit in the pcb and the components.</p>

<p>Worked with fusion360 to again remake the 3D printed enclosure which would fit on a user's shoe. We realized once inserting the PCB into the enclosure that the IO would not be able to be accessed. This would not be ideal as users would need to be able to access the SD card and be able to charge our device. As such I worked to add these in again using the kicad measurements. Additionally I consulted the relevant footprint datasheets for the dimensions of the components which would allow us to fit in the pcb and the components. Additionally the PCB barely fit into the enclosure and as such I scaled up the model by factor 1.01 to account for the expansion and tolerances which may occur when printing with FDM. These I thought would be a final print so I tried using resin as it would be much higher quality and allow for more accurate parts. This mentality and thought process however was a hindrance as it forced me to wait a while for the resin printers to print. Effectively 3x my print time on parts. I also had to use labs which were only open from 4-10pm and 5-11pm. This truly limited the time I'd be allowed to work and as such slowed down development. The resin printing process required a custom slicer for each lab. After the print I'd have to take care not to get resin on me as it is toxic. Additionally I would have to do a 15 minute wash cycle preceded by a 20 minute cure cycle so the resin can harden. However there was an issue with the resin printer as there was a massive hole in one of the enclosures.</p>

<li>make adjustments to cad since PCB has thickness</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>Worked to adjust the 3D fusion model to account for the PCB and its ~2 millimeters of physical thickness. This I forgot about when designing the holes through which the SD card and the micro USB would fit though when placed in the housing. As such I moved all holes on the side up by 2 millimeters. I then reprinted on a resin printer and went through the whole curing and wash cycle process again. As shown in the figure the print turned out well. I then brought this to the lab where Alyssa and I worked on SMD soldering parts to our PCB. This process was long as we not only had to find each component and place it on really small solder pads but bake it in the oven as when we tried the heat gun it was a little inaccurate and too hard to use precisely. I could not imaging using anything smaller than a 805 component as even these were extremely tiny and hard to work with. Overall we got the PCB soldered. We then moved on to try programming it. However we were unable to get it to show up on any COM port on our laptop. We then examined our connections and realized that our board was not getting power. This we realized was since USB did not feed into our LDO which supplies the regulated 3.3v power to our ESP32 board. As such we were forced to solder on a wire connecting the USB 5v power (which also joins with the 3.7-3.3v Battery) to the input on our LDO. This is depicted in the component_markup figure at label P. where we connected these 2 pads. Next we tried connecting over COM with the ESP32 and it showed up. However we were unable to program it and got an error message. We thought it wasn't in the right mode and were proved correct when examining the strippain pin out requirements of the ESP32. We realized that we were supposed to leave IO46 floating and to do so not populate a resistor. As such we unsoldered resistor R9 shown in component_markup. After this we were able to program it successfully. However in order to get serial data to show up we used ESP32S3 BOX instead of ESP32S2 Dev Board to program our board. We don't know why this was the case but we rolled with it. We then tested SD card operations and it didn't work. We tested pressure sensing and it worked. We tested gyro functionality and it worked. After this we called it a night.</p>

<p>Since we now routed a wire around the PCB we had to reprint the model a bit bigger. I also adjusted it so that there would be space for a battery in the top of the enclosure. Additionally I moved down the wire hole so it didn't overlap with the PCB. I also redesigned the closing system to have a little less preciseness. I then started a resin print in siebel. After we met up in the lab to try and debug our PCB.</p>

<p>Found out that SD card pins weren't mappeed right which caused the problem where it wouldn't mount. This was caused as we mapped the pins for SPI protocol according to the pin mappings for an SD card. This should have been easy to fix as we could have changed these pin mappings in software. However since one of the main pins was connected to ground it would have been a lot more challenging. One approach we tried was to splice off a section of the ground plane connected to this ground pin and solder a wire from this large pad to the right place. However this was a little too delicate of a process for us as there were a bunch of wires all around this plane which caused us to have to work a lot more carefully. As such we gave up on pursuing this endeavor. If we were to do another PCB order we would definitely be able to have resolved this connection error on our PCB. I also helped Alyssa to try and fix the IMU by soldering on floating components to connect to the pins which were needed to be powered.Ultimately this took too long and as such we had given up on this process as well. Something we did accomplish was the integration of the LED and the buttons which would show if bluetooth was working, if the sensors were recording and a combination. Some issues we had here was that there was a 100k ohm resistor in series with our LED which caused it to not turn on. We then soldered on a 1k ohm which allowed it to turn off but it was super dim. One change we didn't get to was to convert this 1k ohm to a 47k ohm allowing the LED to be a lot brighter. In terms of the button we had an issue where the button when pressed would discharge and then on the charging a capacitor resistor combination would have a supper high RC circuit charge time. This would cause our software to think the button was constantly pressed. We tested this by console logging the values read by our analog to digital pin reading the voltage of the button press. As such we replaced these components to have a much shorter RC. Finally in this work session we created our final demo presentation slides which helped to guide our audience during our demo.</p>

<h3 id="work-session-record">Work Session Record:</h3>
<p>We got the discharge figured out but it was still a bit finicky. As such we added a delay in software by about 5 seconds where we wouldn't read if the button was pressed so that we wouldn't get any false readings. We also worked to polish up the demo presentation as I attended a peer review demo where the group was asked a bunch of hard questions like temperature, power delivery, and to show the output of their power circuit. As such we had to modify our presentation to include these calculations and readings. However when we did go into the demo we never got asked this. I guess it was asked to try and allow the group that I watched to earn back points. We then did our demo in front of 2 A's and 1 professor. This was fun to showcase what we had been working really hard on all semester. Overall I think it went really well as our demo went without hiccup except for our insole being a little bent causing the insole to have 1 sensor be perpetually high.</p>
