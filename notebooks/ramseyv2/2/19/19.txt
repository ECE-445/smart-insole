# Notebook Entry: February 19, 2024

## Objectives:

1. Integrate the microcontroller into the sensing subsystem.
2. Add control buttons to the status subsystem.
3. Make the wire legend distinct for each subsystem.
4. Update the requirements and verifications table.
5. Calculate storage needs for data collection and finalize storage solution.

## Activities and Findings:

- Edited the block diagram to include the ESP32 microcontroller within the sensing subsystem for enhanced data processing and control.
- Incorporated control buttons (start/end hike, Bluetooth connectivity) into the status subsystem, allowing user interaction directly from the device.
- Revised the wire legend to ensure clear distinction among the subsystems, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.
- Updated the requirements and verification table to reflect the changes made to the system design and functionality.
- Performed a crucial calculation for storage requirements based on sensor data collection rates:
  - 4 bytes per float × ~54 sensors × 5 Hz × 60 sec/min × 60 min/hour × 6 hours × 4 hikes = 93.312 Megabytes. This calculation underscored the need for an SD card due to the ESP32 having only 512 KB of onboard memory.

## Equations, Diagrams, and Figures:

- Equations for storage calculation were detailed to justify the choice of using an SD card for data storage, considering the voluminous data generated by the sensors during hikes.
- Updated block diagrams now feature the microcontroller as part of the sensing subsystem and illustrate the new connections for the control buttons within the status subsystem.
- A distinct wire legend facilitates understanding of the complex wiring required for the system's functionality.

## Conclusion:

The session successfully integrated essential components and updated the design documentation to reflect these changes. The calculated storage requirements led to the decision to use an SD card, ensuring sufficient data storage capacity for the project's needs.
