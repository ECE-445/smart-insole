# Notebook Entry for Today's Session

**Date:** February 15, 2024

## Objectives for the Session:

### Software Design Section for Smart Insole Project:
- Detailed aspects of "Data Collection, Aggregation, and Transmission" and "Web Interface".

## Record of Activities:

### Data Collection, Aggregation, and Transmission:
- Described the software flow, starting from Bluetooth pairing mode and transitioning into main operational phases.
- The software records sensor data during hikes and writes this information to storage.
- It sends data packets to a connected device via a web interface for real-time tracking or backup.

### Web Interface:
- Outlined the development of a web interface for offloading data from the ESP32 device.
- Detailed the use of BLEServer, BLEService, and BLECharacteristic modules for Bluetooth services.
- The interface will utilize the Web Bluetooth API for connecting to the ESP32, enabling data transfer and interaction with device services and characteristics.
- Plans include displaying hiking statistics through charts and graphs using Next.js and various NPM modules.

## Diagrams and Figures:
- Flowcharts depicting the logic for data collection and transmission.
- Architectural diagrams for the web interface setup and Bluetooth communication.

## Conclusion:
- Successfully documented the software design aspects of the Smart Insole project, focusing on efficient data handling and user interaction through a web interface.
